# CellularAutomata
A small cellular automata made in unity.

Similar to Conways game of life, the cellular automata works with simple rules dictating movement.
In this case, attractional/repulsional forces are applied to the cells dependent on the neighbouring cells and their distance.

Similar to conways game of life, emergent features such as gliders can be seen.

# Want to fiddle with parameters?
Parameters can be found in the spawner object in the unity project.
cell behaviours are defined by cures within the prefabs.
